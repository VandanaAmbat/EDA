An Exploratory Data analysis is done in this project on the Employee Details of a particular company. Through this study, I try to give an insight into an overall idea on the content of the file along with some detailed analysis on various aspects of an employee like salary, positions held, age group etc.

For easy analysis:


     Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas are imported.
     Data Cleaning is done by removing irregularities, unwanted datas, duplicates etc.
     Identifying Unique values is carried out.
     Data visualisation is done for easy interpreatation and understanding.
